:::note
The extent to which the library determines that a type does not satisfy [`LegacyInputIterator`](#) is **unspecified**,
except that as a minimum:
 - Integral types do not qualify as input iterators. 

Likewise, the extent to which it determines that a type does not satisfy [`Allocator`](#) is **unspecified**,
except that as a minimum:
 - The member type `Alloc::value_type` must exist.
 - The expression [`std::declval<Alloc&>().allocate(std::size_t{})`](#) must be well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand.
