This is the official repo of [cpp-lang.net](https://cpp-lang.net) website.

It was originally created and is maintained by PaweÅ‚ Syska (@PoetaKodu).

## âš½ Goals

The main goal is to finally give C++ a proper, well designed
and open-source website with a modern learning course,
a good and readable documentation that uses modern technology.

### ðŸš€ [The learning course](https://cpp-lang.net/learn/)

We focus on simplicity. The teaching that people can't understand
is a bad teaching.

### ðŸ“š [The documentation](https://cpp-lang.net/docs/)

Documentation that contains **facts** presented in a way
that people can understand it. We want to pack the documentation
full of examples.

### ðŸ›  [The tool knowledge base](https://cpp-lang.net/tools/)

Picking the best programming tool should not involve days
of searching. We provide a summary of available C++ programming tools.

### ðŸ§± [The features knowledge base](https://cpp-lang.net/features/)

We want programmers to know what C++ is capable of.
You'll find here the traits that define the language.
The most modern ways to code.

## ðŸ’» Our tech

The website is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

We use React to design compontents and pages, and Markdown React (`.mdx`)
to write course lessons, articles, docs etc.

</p>

Docusaurus is a fantastic tool that we, as C++ programmers should leverage.

## ðŸ“– Our methodology

We teach things using examples from the real world.
We provide graphs, images, presentations and videos that
help understand the learning material. 
## ðŸ˜Ž Get involved!

Do you want to help with building the best C++ website?

Everyone can help!
We search for people that can:
- improve the courses
- translate courses, docs, articles, etc.
- ... or help promote the website. Tell your friends about it ðŸ˜„
