# Introduction to variables

In this lesson, we'll talk about how to store different values while a program
is running, that is, how to use variables.

## Motivation

To understand what they are useful for, let's write a program that raises a number
to the third power and then displays it:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="üîπ main.cpp | Power of three"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << 212 * 212 * 212;
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
9528128
```

</div>
</Columns>

If we now want to raise a different number to the third power, we will have
to change three places in the code. It is tedious.

### Solution

In order not to change so many things every time, let's assume for a moment
that the number we are raising to the power of three is called `x`.
What will the code look like then?

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << x * x * x;
}
```

The above program at this stage **will not compile**. To use `x` in a calculation,
we first need to create a **variable** named `x`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	int x = 212;
	std::cout << x * x * x;
}
```

The above program will compile and run correctly.

:::important Variable definition
A **variable** is a container for data of a certain type.
:::

## Creating variables

In the above program, we created the variable like this:

```cpp
int x = 212;
```

Here is a diagram of this notation:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="creation-init" label="üî¢ With initial value" default>
		<Image center maxheight={250}
				src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/variables/creation-init-en.png"
				alt="Scheme for creating a variable (with initialization)"
			/>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="creation" label="‚ö™ Without value">
		<Image center maxheight={250}
				src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/variables/creation-en.png"
				alt="Scheme for creating a variable (without initialization)"
			/>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This <u>extremely important</u> notation consists of the following elements:

Element | Description
---|---
**`int`** | variable type
`x` | variable name
`= 212` | **initialization** (assignment of the initial value)
`;` | a semicolon that ends the statement

### Variable type

The type of a variable tells you what the variable can store. As mentioned before,
a variable is a container that holds certain things of a **certain type**.

`int` is an abbreviation of the word *integer* that is, a number without the fractional part.

At this stage, you should remember the following types of variables:

Type | Description
--- | ---
**`int`** | integer
**`float`** | real number (with fractional part)
**`char`** | a single character
**`bool`** | boolean value, i.e. `true` or `false`

We will cover more types and facts about them in the future.

:::danger
The above-mentioned types of variables are always written with **lowercase letters**. It matters.
:::

#### Examples of creating variables:

<hr/>

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="int" label={<code>int</code>} default>

```cpp
// Without initialization
// Variable will contain an unpredictable value
int x;

// We create a variable and assign the 30 value to it
int y = 30;
```


	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="float" label={<code>float</code>}>

```cpp
// Without initialization
// Variable will contain an unpredictable value
float x;

// We create a variable and assign the 30 value to it
float y = 30;

// We create a variable and assign the 1.234 value to it
float z = 1.234f;
```

:::caution Fractional part
When we assign a value with a fractional part to a variable of type `float`,
we must end the number with the `f` character:

- ‚úî `12.45f`
- ‚ùå `12.45`

This has its justification, but more on that later.
:::

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="char" label={<code>char</code>}>

```cpp
// Without initialization
// Variable will contain an unpredictable value
char x;

// We create a variable and assign the 'j' character to it
char y = 'j';
```

:::danger Characters
Single characters are **always** written between <u>single quotes</u>.
- character: `'c'`
- a **string of characters**, consisting of 1 character: `"c"`

Therefore:
- ‚úî `char x = 'c';`
- ‚ùå `char x = "c";`
:::

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="bool" label={<code>bool</code>}>

```cpp
// Without initialization
// Variable will contain an unpredictable value
bool x;

// We create a variable and assign the "true" value to it
bool y = true;

// We create a variable and assign the "false" value to it
bool z = false;
```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<hr/>

### Variable name

The name can be anything you want, with some important restrictions:

- ‚ùå must not have spaces (prohibited: ‚ùå `abc def`)
- ‚úî may consist of:
	- ‚úî characters `a`-`z` and `A`-`Z`
	- ‚úî digits, but not at the beginning (prohibited: ‚ùå `932abc`)
	- ‚úî underscore `_`

You can create as many variables as you want, but they must have different names
as they are their unique identifiers (with some exceptions, but more on that later).

Case of the letters is important, variable names are case-sensitive:

```cpp
int x = 30;
float X = 12.34f;
```

In the code above, the variables `x` and `X` are two different variables!

:::tip Good practice (for non-english speakers)
It's best to use **only** English names, for example:
```cpp
float average;
```

instead of:

```cpp
float srednia; // average in Polish
```
:::

### Initialization (initial value)

Initialization is an optional step in creating variables. When we create it, we can
either leave it without the desired value:

```cpp
int x;
```

or assign it an initial value:

```cpp
int x = 30;
```

:::caution NO INITIALIZATION
An uninitialized variable, inside a function block (e.g. inside `main`) will initially have
an unpredictable value, it won't be reset to 0.

Leaving a variable without its initial value can cause problems later in the code.
Sometimes, however, we may intentionally skip it, but more on that later.
:::

### Semicolon at the end

Just a remainder üòÄ

```cpp
int name = 40;
```

## Opportunities

In this section, I will only show you a few ways to use variables,
while their explaination is in the next lesson.

### Receiving input from the user

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	int age; // current age
	std::cout << "Enter your age: ";
	std::cin >> age;
	std::cout << "In 10 years you will be: " << age + 10 << " years\n";
}
```

## Summary

<ImproveSection />

To summarize, we:
- know how to [create a variable](#creating-variables)
- understand the difference between [types of variables](#variable-type)


## Additional info

### Lack of initialization

```cpp title="üîπ Example"
int main() {
	int x; // No initializer
}
```

An uninitialized variable (without an assigned value at the beginning), inside a function block (e.g. inside `main`)
will have an unpredictable value at the beginning, **won't be set to zero**.
Leaving a variable without an initial value **can cause problems** later in the code execution.
However, sometimes we can intentionally skip this, but about that some other time.

### Type conversion

A variable has a specific type that cannot be arbitrarily changed in different places in the code.
The values that we try to write into it must match its type.
For example, we can write to a variable of type `float` (a real number)
an integer (`int`):

```cpp title="üîπ Example"
float y = 30; // OK
```

A variable of type `int` cannot store a fractional part, so when we try to write such a value to it
it will be **converted**, but no rounding will occur, just a truncation of the fractional part.

```cpp title="‚ö† Implicit conversion"
int y = 30.5f; // OK, converted to 30
```

The compiler analyzing the code *may* issue a warning that there is an **implicit** conversion.
Implicit because we could use such a notation unintentionally and get the wrong value.
