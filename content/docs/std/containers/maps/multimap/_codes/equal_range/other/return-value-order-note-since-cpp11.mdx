Since [`emplace()`](/docs/std/containers/maps/multimap/emplace) and unhinted [`insert()`](/docs/std/containers/maps/multimap/insert) always insert at the upper bound,
the order of equivalent elements in the equal range is the order of insertion unless hinted [`insert()`](/docs/std/containers/maps/multimap/insert) or [`emplace_hint()`](/docs/std/containers/maps/multimap/emplace_hint) was used to insert an element at a different position.
