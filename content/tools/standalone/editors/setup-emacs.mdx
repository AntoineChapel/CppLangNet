# Emacs setup

In this article, we will discuss how to setup Emacs for C++ development on Linux easily.

## Introduction

Emacs is one of the oldest and most versatile text editors available for Linux and
UNIX-based systems. It’s been around for a long time (more than twenty years for GNU emacs)
and is well known for its powerful and rich editing features. Emacs is also more than just
a text editor; it can be customized and extended with different “modes”, enabling it to be
used like an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming languages like C++, Java,
C or Python.

In this article, we will be configuring `lsp-mode` (Language Server Protocol) of emacs for
C++ development. It is advised to learn the basic keybinds like saving a file, searchin a file,
searching in a file, etc of Emacs before satrting using it.

:::important Note
This article for setting up Emacs is deicated to novice programmers who want to do C++ development
in Emacs. After configuring Emacs according to this article, user will be able to get basic
functionality like Code-Completion, Real-time Syntax checking, Code Navigation etc.
For advance configuration of `lsp-mode` for C++ development, refer [here](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/)
:::


## Downloading and Installing

We will be installing Emacs from terminal in Linux.

First, we have to open up the terminal; we can use the shortcut
`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `t` or we can manually open it up by searching it in
the menu

**Command 1:** To begin, update the packages list using the below command
```
sudo apt-get update
```
This command is used to download package information from all configured
sources and to get the info of the updated versions of the packages.

:::important Note
**sudo** *(Super User DO)* enables a permitted user to run a command as
the *superuser* or another user, depending on the security policy. So,
if required, enter your system password to proceed.
:::

**Command 2:** Now we will download Emacs by the following command
```
sudo apt-get install emacs
```
If required enter your system *password* to proceed.
After download, you can check if Emacs is successfully installed in your
system
```
emacs --version
```
If installed successfully, output would be like this

**Output:**

<Image center
       alt="Output for `emacs --version`"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/emacs-version.jpg"
    />


Now we're good to customize Emacs, just open the *intitialization* file of Emacs
```
cd ~/.emacs.d && emacs init.el
```
All the customizing code for Emacs will be written in `init.el` file.

:::important Note
Every time when it is mentioned here to save the file, it is meant to execute
`C-x``C-s` (`Control + x`, then `Control + s`) keybind and evry time when it is
mentioned here to execute the latest command/code from Emacs, it is meant to
execute `C-x``C-e` (`Control + x`, then `Control + e`) with cursor at the very end of the command/code.

## General Customization of Emacs

:::important Note
This section is completely ***optional***. This section doesn't contribute towards
C++ development. In this section, we will just configuring looks of Emacs.
:::


When emacs is opened, it generally start with a startup message. If you want to disable it,
enter this in your `init.el` file
```lisp title="init.el"
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
```


For making scroll bar invisible
```lisp title="init.el"
(toggle-scroll-bar -1)
```
Save the file and execute this line.
For making it visibe again, just replace `-1` with `t`.


For making menu bar invisible
```lisp title="init.el"
(menu-bar-mode -1)
```
Save the file and execute this line.
For making it visibe again, just replace `-1` with `t`.


For making tool bar invisible
```lisp title="init.el"
(tool-bar-mode -1)
```
Save the file and execute this line.
For making it visibe again, just replace `-1` with `t`.


For making line number visible in front of every new line
```lisp title="init.el"
(global-linum-mode t)
```
Save the file and execute this line.
For making it invisibe again, just replace `t` with `-1`.


## Setting up MELPA and `use-package`

### Setting up MELPA
MELPA (Milkypostman's Emacs Lisp Package Archive) is an ELPA-compatible package repository
that contains an enormous amount of useful Emacs packages.
Add the following code and execute it in order to download other packages required to configure
Emacs for C++ Development.

```lisp title="init.el"
(require 'package)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
	     '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
	     '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
```
After executing the above lines of code, 5000+ packages will be available to you for downloading
inside emacs. You can see them by running following command
```
M-x package-list-packages RET
```

**Output:**
<Image center
       alt="List of packages in Emacs"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/package-list.jpg"
    />

### Setting up `use-package`

Add following code in `init.el` and execute it.
```lisp title="init.el"
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
```
