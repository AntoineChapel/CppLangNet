# Emacs setup

In this article, we will discuss how to setup Emacs for C++ development on Linux easily.

## Introduction

Emacs is one of the oldest and most versatile text editors available for Linux and
UNIX-based systems. It’s been around for a long time (more than twenty years for GNU emacs)
and is well known for its powerful and rich editing features. Emacs is also more than just
a text editor; it can be customized and extended with different “modes”, enabling it to be
used like an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming languages like C++, Java,
C or Python.

## Downloading and Installing

We will be installing Emacs from terminal in Linux.

First, we have to open up the terminal; we can use the shortcut
`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `t` or we can manually open it up by searching it in
the menu

**Command 1:** To begin, update the packages list using the below command
```
sudo apt-get update
```
This command is used to download package information from all configured
sources and to get the info of the updated versions of the packages.

:::important Note
**sudo** *(Super User DO)* enables a permitted user to run a command as
the *superuser* or another user, depending on the security policy. So,
if required, enter your system password to proceed.
:::

**Command 2:** Now we will download Emacs by the following command
```
sudo apt-get install emacs
```
If required enter your system *password* to proceed.
