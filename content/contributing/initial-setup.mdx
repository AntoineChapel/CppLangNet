# Initial setup

## Creating your local copy of the site

To efficiently edit the website, you'll have to create a personal fork,
of the repository.

Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Once you've cloned the repo, run following commands:

```bash title="ðŸ”¹ Performing clean install"
npm ci
```

To start a site in the default locale (English):
```bash
npm start
```

To start a site in an other locale, for example Polish (notice the double dash in between):

```bash
npm start -- --locale pl
```

## Visual Studio Code setup

If you use VS Code, copy the folder named `.vscode-template` and rename it to `.vscode`.
It contains useful snippets and a configuration for an addon, that you might want to use:
