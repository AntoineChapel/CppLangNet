# General editing rules and tips

import ImproveSection from "@site/i18n/en/presets/ImproveSection.mdx";

## Write simple

The main goal is to make it as easy to understand as possible.
Imagine that you teach your 9 year old nephew how to program.
When you teach someone a new topic, assume that the student does not know anything
about it yet.

## Use images, GIFs, video links

Do not flood the students with pages full of text only.
Roughly 1/3 of the content should be in a graphical form.
Prefer showing, not only talking about it.

## Be careful with links

There is a known issue with a trailing slash at the end of page URL.
By default, we assume, that our URLs end with a slash.

Let's say that you have a following folder structure:

```
- docs
  - std
  --> index.mdx
	- math
	--> functions.mdx
```

When you open the `std/index.mdx`, it will be used as a [default document](../default-documents) from that directory, with following url:
```
https://cpp-lang.net/docs/std/		<-- notice the trailing slash
```

To add a link to `std/math/functions.mdx` you'll have to use:

```md
[Math functions](math/functions)

or

<a href="math/functions">Math functions</a>
```

because we're already inside of the `docs/std/` folder, **because of the trailing slash**.
That leads to an unexpected behavior, if you want to reference a document from the same directory,
when the referencing document **is not** a default document.

Lets now consider the following folder structure:

```
- docs
--> foo.mdx
--> bar.mdx
```

If you open the `foo` document, the URL will be:

```
https://cpp-lang.net/docs/foo/		<-- notice the trailing slash!
```

This creates a false impression that the `foo` is a directory, which it isn't.
If you want to reference `bar` from the `foo` document, you'll have to start at the parent directory (docs):

```md
[Bar](../bar)

or

<a href="../bar">Bar</a>
```


## Add tags

Tags help people find the topic they're interested in.
Please add tags to the document metadata.

```mdx
---
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

## Use admonitions (notes, tips, cautions, dangers)

To create a fancy looking admonition, use the following syntax:

```mdx
:::tip Title
This is a tip
:::

:::note Title
This is a note
:::

:::important Title
This is an important note
:::

:::caution Title
This is a caution note
:::

:::danger Title
This is a danger note
:::
```

Preview:

<div style={ {border: "1px solid gray", padding: 30, marginBottom: 30} }>


:::tip Title
This is a tip
:::

:::note Title
This is a note
:::

:::important Title
This is an important note
:::

:::caution Title
This is a caution note
:::

:::danger Title
This is a danger note
:::

</div>
